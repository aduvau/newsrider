# Newsrider

ðŸ“° Minimalist, handcrafted newsletter parser â€” built from scratch in Go.

This is a personal learning project to explore Go and build a tiny, functional alternative to Readwise, starting with a simple HTML newsletter parser.

## Goals

- Parse HTML newsletters into readable summaries
- Display them in the terminal
- Eventually support Markdown or JSON output
- Stay as framework-free and minimal as possible
- Test-driven development

## Status

ðŸ”§ Work in progress â€” currently setting up the first parser module.
